# Description
This repository scraps images of pals from the video game PalWorld. It scrapes the images from the [pal wiki](https://palworld.wiki.gg/).

# Installation
This repository has an `environment.yml` file for creating the conda environment needed to run the code:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pal-scrape
```

# Running
All code for scraping and saving images can be found in the `notebook.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

# Notes
Some pals do not return images, still a work in progress.
